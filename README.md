# The Rigoberta Game

This is the source code for my [game](https://reesporte.itch.io/rigoberta). It's written in C++. I used [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to make a custom game engine from scratch. The music was also made by me! All images were available in the creative commons or created by me.

This is definitely still a little buggy, and there are some TODOs left around. There's also likely some strange comments left in there somewhere that I forgot to remove. Pull requests welcome!

## To play:

I recommend downloading the latest version from [itch.io](https://reesporte.itch.io/rigoberta), it's completely free and available for MacOS and Windows.

#### alternatively:
To build from source on Mac:
```
1. install SFML
2. cd to the directory you downloaded this repo to
3. make run
```
This also may/may not work for linux, untested. At the very least, you can compile it with gcc.
